## 5.1. 2-Week Sprint Plan Example (Focus: Initial AI Model Integration - Milestone 1.3 from Roadmap)

Here's an example sprint plan focusing on integrating the "Optimal Posting Time Advisor" AI model.

### Sprint Goal

Integrate the "Optimal Posting Time Advisor" AI model, establish a reliable data pipeline, create and test an internal API endpoint, and validate the model's performance.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **AI Model Accuracy:** Achieve >75% accuracy on a test dataset.
- **API Endpoint Availability & Latency:** Develop and deploy the API endpoint within 8 working days, responding within <500ms under load.
- **Data Pipeline Integrity:** Process new user engagement data within 1 hour of ingestion.
- **Code Quality & Test Coverage:** Achieve >80% unit test coverage for new backend modules with <3 critical or high-severity bugs.
- **Team Velocity:** Complete X story points based on team capacity and estimation.
- **End-to-End Test:** One successful end-to-end test on the staging environment.

This sprint plan ensures a focused and measurable approach to integrating the AI model and sets a strong foundation for the product's development.

Formulating sprint goals and KPIs for AI-heavy sprints requires a specific focus on verifiable AI milestones, not just general feature completion. Traditional software development measures progress by the number of features built or bugs fixed. However, for AI components, progress is also about the "intelligence" itselfâ€”its accuracy, data pipelines, and the ability of other systems to consume its outputs.

Thus, for sprints involving AI model development or integration, goals must be explicitly tied to achievements such as deploying a specific model version, establishing its data flow, validating its outputs against benchmarks, or improving its accuracy. KPIs like "model accuracy on a test dataset" or "data processing latency for AI inference" provide concrete measures of progress in the AI system's capabilities.

This approach ensures AI development is a series of tangible, demonstrable advancements that contribute directly to the product's core value.

## 5.2. Handling Scope Changes and Blockers

To maintain sprint integrity and development momentum, a clear process for managing scope changes and addressing blockers is essential:

### Handling Scope Changes (Scope Creep)

- **Submission & Evaluation:** Scope change requests are submitted to the Technical Product Manager (TPM), who evaluates them based on alignment with the product vision, impact on sprint goals, overall priorities, customer value, and technical effort.
- **Decision Process:** Minor clarifications or bug fixes may be accepted if they don't jeopardize sprint goals. Significant changes or new feature requests are typically added to the product backlog for future sprints. In rare cases, critical changes are accommodated by de-scoping existing work and adjusting sprint goals.
- **Communication:** All decisions regarding scope changes are documented and communicated transparently to relevant stakeholders.

### Handling Blockers

- **Identification:** Blockers are identified during daily stand-up meetings, encouraging proactive communication.
- **Initial Resolution Attempt:** Team members attempt to resolve blockers within their team or with direct collaborators.
- **Escalation Path:** If a blocker cannot be resolved within a short timeframe, it is escalated to the Engineering Lead, who resolves the impediment or escalates it to the Technical Product Manager if necessary. The TPM then takes ownership of resolving the blocker, which may involve coordinating with other team leads, departments, or business leadership.
- **Tracking & Visibility:** All identified blockers and their resolution status are tracked visibly to ensure awareness and focus on resolution.

In AI development, managing blockers requires agility and specialized expertise. AI projects can face unique impediments such as data quality issues or unexpected AI model behavior. These blockers may not be solvable by the core software engineering team alone.

The blocker management process must ensure rapid access to data science and data engineering expertise. When an AI-specific blocker is identified, the escalation path should involve specialists quickly to diagnose the root cause and propose solutions. Prompt engagement of specialized knowledge is crucial to minimize disruption to the sprint and maintain progress on AI-related deliverables.
